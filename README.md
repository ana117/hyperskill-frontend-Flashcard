## Stages
**Stage 1/3: Setting up**\
Think about the contents of your flashcards and write the questions for the front side. Create a simple web page with the header and the text of the questions.

**Stage 2/3: Design**\
Let's make the page more attractive by applying different styles. You will explore the core CSS topics and use them in practice immediately.

**Stage 3/3: On the flip side**\
Add the back side with the answers for each card and apply animation to create the "card flip" effect.
